README.md for Project: udjawtic0

## Project: udjawtic0

This project utilizes the FreeBASIC compiler within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for development and debugging on a desktop environment.

### 1. Development Environment Setup

To work with this project, you'll need the following:

*   **FreeBASIC Compiler:** Download and install the latest stable version of FreeBASIC from the official website.
*   **IDE with Debugging Capabilities:** While FreeBASIC can be used with various text editors, an IDE greatly enhances the development experience. Recommended options include:
    *   **FBEdit:** A dedicated IDE for FreeBASIC.
    *   **Geany:** A lightweight and versatile IDE that supports FreeBASIC with proper configuration.
    *   **Code::Blocks:** A more feature-rich IDE that can be configured for FreeBASIC.
    *   **Visual Studio Code:** With appropriate extensions, VS Code can be a powerful FreeBASIC development environment.

### 2. Project Structure

The project directory (`./udjawtic0`) is expected to contain your FreeBASIC source files and any other related assets. A typical structure might look like this:

```
./udjawtic0/
├── src/
│   └── main.bas       // Main FreeBASIC source file
├── include/           // Optional: For header files
├── lib/               // Optional: For static or dynamic libraries
├── bin/               // Optional: For compiled executables (can be generated by the IDE)
├── obj/               // Optional: For object files (can be generated by the IDE)
└── README.md          // This file
```

### 3. Developing FreeBASIC Files

*   **Source Files:** All FreeBASIC source code files should have the `.bas` extension (e.g., `main.bas`, `module1.bas`).
*   **Syntax:** Refer to the FreeBASIC documentation for language syntax and features.

### 4. Compiling the Project

Most IDEs will have a "Build" or "Compile" command. Ensure your IDE is correctly configured to use the FreeBASIC compiler.

*   **Command Line Compilation (if not using an IDE's build system):**
    ```bash
    fbc -lang fb -o bin/udjawtic0 src/main.bas
    ```
    *   `fbc`: The FreeBASIC compiler command.
    *   `-lang fb`: Specifies the FreeBASIC language dialect.
    *   `-o bin/udjawtic0`: Specifies the output executable file and its location.
    *   `src/main.bas`: The main source file to compile.

### 5. Debugging

Debugging is a crucial part of software development. Modern IDEs provide integrated debuggers that allow you to:

*   **Set Breakpoints:** Pause program execution at specific lines of code.
*   **Step Through Code:** Execute code line by line.
*   **Inspect Variables:** View the current values of variables.
*   **Call Stack:** See the sequence of function calls that led to the current point.

#### General Debugging Steps (within an IDE):

1.  **Configure Debugger:** Ensure your IDE's debugger is configured to work with FreeBASIC executables. This often involves specifying the path to a debugger like GDB (GNU Debugger) if it's not built-in.
2.  **Set Breakpoints:** Click in the gutter next to the line numbers in your source code to set breakpoints.
3.  **Start Debugging:** Use the "Debug" or "Run with Debugger" command in your IDE.
4.  **Control Execution:** Use controls like "Step Over," "Step Into," "Step Out," and "Continue" to navigate through your code.
5.  **Examine Data:** Use the "Watch" window or hover over variables to see their values.

### 6. Example Screenshot of an IDE (Conceptual)

Here's a conceptual representation of what an IDE might look like while developing and debugging a FreeBASIC project:

This image depicts a retro-style CRT monitor displaying a conceptual IDE interface.
On the desktop, you can see an icon for "README.md".
Inside the IDE window, there's a file explorer pane, a code editor showing `main.bas` with a breakpoint (red circle) at line 13 and a highlighted current execution line at line 17.
There are also "WATCH" and "CALL STACK" panes, and a console output showing compilation and debugging messages.

### 7. Files in this Project (`./udjawtic0`)

*   **`main.bas`**: The primary FreeBASIC source file for the `udjawtic0` project. This is where your main program logic resides.
*   **`README.md`**: This file, providing instructions and project overview.
