'' To verify the selection of files in FreeBasic, you can use 
'' the following approaches:

'' *File Selection Methods*
'' 1. *Command-line arguments*: Use `COMMAND$` to access command-line arguments and verify file selections.
'' 2. *File dialogs*: Use a GUI library like `fbGFX` or `fbTk` to create file dialogs and allow users to select files.
'' 3. *User input*: Use `INPUT` or `LINE INPUT` to gather file paths from users and verify their existence.

'' *Verification Techniques*
'' 1. *File existence*: Use `DIR$("file_path")` to check if a file exists.
'' 2. *File attributes*: Use `GETATTR("file_path")` to retrieve file attributes and verify file types.

'' *Example Code*
'' ```
'' basic
DIM file_path AS STRING
file_path = COMMAND$ ' get command-line argument

IF DIR(file_path) = "" THEN
    PRINT "File not found: " & file_path
ELSE
    PRINT "File found: " & file_path
END IF

''    ```

'' This example demonstrates how to verify the existence of a file 
'' selected via command-line argument.

'' Do you have specific questions about verifying file selections 
'' in FreeBasic?
